# Find the @boardname@ puzzle (using radio signal strength) 

For this project you have to use your @boardname@ to find four other @boardnames@ in the top hall. You need to find them in the right order and then press button ``||A||`` to reveal a letter from each @boardname@.

The four letters are the first four letter of a five letter word which you can use to open a padlocked box. If you open the box you will win the house points inside!
